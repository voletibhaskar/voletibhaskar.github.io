🙋🏾‍♂️Hello! Welcome to my LinkedIn. My name is Bhaskar Voleti and I’m currently looking for Winter 2023 Co-op opportunities as a Data Scientist/ Data Analyst.💼

👨🏾‍🎓After completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science, alongside my work experiences through various job opportunites, I have found a keen interest in the world of Finance.🔍

 ✨I have found passion in working with ETL Data Pipelines for various clients in North America and Europe across various sectors generating Business insights through Data Visualization. 📈

🧘🏾‍♂️ What do I do outside of work? I love to spend some quality time with my friends/family and keep myself busy with visualizations and data science storytelling projects.

🗣 Enough about me!! I’d love to get to know you as well! Feel free to reach out to me for coffee chats and all things related to Analytics 😊

What else do you need?
