### Introduction to Canadian economy after COVID
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant social and economic impacts on Canada. According to Statistics Canada, the pandemic led to a 17% decrease in output compared to pre-pandemic levels, and over 132,000 hospitalizations and 35,000 deaths. 

The pandemic also affected the mental health and well-being of Canadians, with a sharp decline in self-reported mental health, especially among young Canadians.

The economic disruption led to job losses, reduced employment income, and challenges related to inflation and affordability. Canada's per-capita GDP growth and employment growth were also affected, though there were improvements in 2021. 

The government implemented various measures to respond to these impacts, targeting diverse groups of Canadians through its COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.

### Government's Economic Status

#### Government Debt Status

The **debt-to-GDP ratio of Canada** is a key indicator of the country's fiscal health. As of 2024, the IMF officially reported Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio as **106%**. However, the **World Economics GDP** database suggests a lower ratio of **91.9% when using Purchasing Power Parity terms**. 

This indicates a significant level of government debt relative to the size of the economy. According to Fitch Ratings, they project the general government **gross debt (GGGD) to decline further to 96.5% by 2025**. 

The high debt-to-GDP ratio reflects the economic challenges faced by Canada, and it is an important metric for assessing the country's financial stability and its ability to meet its debt obligations.

When we have such unsustainable amounts of Government Debt, the economy doesn't have any additional capital to inject in the economy for any infrastructure development. Leading to economic stagnation as the economic market forces doesnt see any demand for products.

10. The **Energy** CPI experienced a slight decrease of **-0.4%**.

The data indicates a general increase in consumer prices across various sectors, with notable rises in food, shelter, and transportation prices. These increases have contributed to the overall rise in the All-items CPI. 

The Energy sector experienced a slight decrease, which partially offset the overall increase in consumer prices.
