The Top Socio-Economic Trends Shaping Canada in 2024. This is the first part of the series discussing all aspects related to Canada.

## Workforce Exposure Overview

<img src="https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/ec41fc929ea602de6613cf90e85c6b20/7c2a6ab8-5f1a-4604-b75b-fb8c55bd47a5/5b5a9b5f.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

Over half of Canadian workers (57.4%) are in jobs with high AI exposure, representing 10.71 million people.

Over half of Canada's workforce (57.4%, representing 10.71 million workers) face high AI exposure in their jobs, while 42.6% (7.96 million workers) are in low-exposure roles.[^1][^2]

![High AI exposure jobs split almost evenly between AI-augmenting roles (51%) and AI-competing roles (49%).](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/ec41fc929ea602de6613cf90e85c6b20/cc867b06-653c-4187-9d51-8966af764c6e/9aa3ba2b.png)

High AI exposure jobs split almost evenly between AI-augmenting roles (51%) and AI-competing roles (49%).

Among high-exposure jobs, there's an almost even split: 51% are AI-augmenting roles where AI enhances human work, and 49% are AI-competing roles where AI may automate core tasks.[^2]

## Employment Growth Patterns

![AI-augmenting roles showed stronger employment growth (2.9%) compared to AI-competing roles and the overall job market (both 1.6%) in 2024.](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/df0e536c0b51d6725f530d620ee6604b/1a57ca31-7425-43b9-9541-152b0d8727d5/6088b1f5.png)

AI-augmenting roles showed stronger employment growth (2.9%) compared to AI-competing roles and the overall job market (both 1.6%) in 2024.

AI-augmenting roles are outperforming the market with 2.9% employment growth in 2024, compared to just 1.6% for both AI-competing roles and the overall job market.[^2]

## Job Decline in AI-Competing Roles

![Desktop publishing operators saw the steepest decline (-12.4%) among AI-competing roles, followed by sales occupations (-11.7%) and editors (-8.7%).](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/ec41fc929ea602de6613cf90e85c6b20/a8d2c5ee-148d-467d-90a0-2c87e1e3c15b/2c5673b4.png)

## Sector Adoption vs Exposure

![Sectors with higher job exposure to AI show stronger adoption rates, with information/cultural (35.6% adoption, 85 exposure), finance (30.6%, 82), and professional services (31.7%, 78) leading.](https://ppl-ai-code-interpreter-files.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/ec41fc929ea602de6613cf90e85c6b20/f3829bb7-cc22-4c8a-872f-19eeb941d979/ee7b8fd2.png)

Sectors with higher job exposure to AI show stronger adoption rates, with information/cultural (35.6% adoption, 85 exposure), finance (30.6%, 82), and professional services (31.7%, 78) leading.

Clear correlation exists between job exposure and AI adoption rates. High-exposure sectors like information/cultural industries (85 exposure level, 35.6% adoption), finance (82 exposure, 30.6% adoption), and professional services (78 exposure, 31.7% adoption) lead adoption, while low-exposure sectors like construction (35 exposure, 8.4% adoption) and accommodation/food (28 exposure, 6.1% adoption) lag.[^3]

These visualizations reveal that AI's impact on Canada's job market is creating clear winners and losers. Jobs requiring human creativity, judgment, and relationship skills are growing faster than ever, while routine task-based roles face significant pressure. The data strongly suggests that AI literacy and continuous upskilling are no longer optional—they're essential for career resilience in 2025 and beyond.
